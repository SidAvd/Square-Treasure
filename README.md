# Game Rules - Functionality
The game consists of a board of square tiles. The goal of the game is to find the diamond,
which hides in one of the squares with as few moves as possible. Each square reveals how
far from the diamond is when pressed. If it is further than three squares it gives no 
information and shows a questionmark. The interface shows the number of moves in each given
time and also contains a restart button.

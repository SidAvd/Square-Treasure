# Square Treasure - React Native
Square Treasure is a minsweeper-inspired game for android and iOS, made in React Native.

# Game Rules
The game consists of a board of square tiles. The goal of the game is to find the diamond,
which hides in one of the squares with as few moves as possible. Each square reveals how
far from the diamond is when pressed. If it is further than three squares it gives no 
information and shows a questionmark.
